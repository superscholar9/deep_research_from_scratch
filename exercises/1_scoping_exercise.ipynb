    "# Exercise: Alternet User Clarification and Brief Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lesson, you were presented with an invitation to try an altenate implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One implementation of this is shown below. You can compare it to your implementation. \n",
    "You can add suggestions or comments to the course or the student forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we used **structured output** with Pydantic schemas (`ClarifyWithUser`) to control workflow decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there's an alternative approach using **tool binding** that's worth exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structured Output v Tool Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "structured_output_model = model.with_structured_output(ClarifyWithUser)\n",
    "response = structured_output_model.invoke([...])\n",
    "\n",
    "if response.need_clarification:\n",
    "    return Command(goto=END, ...)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    return Command(goto=\"write_research_brief\", ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Predictable, deterministic workflow control\n",
    "- Clear schema validation  \n",
    "- Less prone to hallucination\n",
    "- Faster and more cost-effective\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of structured output, we could bind tools to the LLM to tell it to go ahead and write the research brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def proceed_with_research(verification_message: str) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Call this tool when you have enough information to proceed with research.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"Proceeding with research: {verification_message}\"\n",
    "\n",

    "def clarify_with_user(state: AgentState):\n",
    "    response = llm_with_tools.invoke([...])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Check if tools were called\n",
    "    if response.tool_calls:\n",
    "        tool_call = response.tool_calls[0]\n",
    "        if tool_call[\"name\"] == \"proceed_with_research\":\n",
    "            return Command(goto=\"write_research_brief\", update={\"messages\": [AIMessage(content=tool_call[\"args\"][\"verification_message\"])]})\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try implementing the tool calling approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to modify the prompts to instruct the LLM to use the tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "This also gives to more feedback to add additional tools in this scoping phase, if needed! \n",
